	<h1>PRIZES</h1>

	<p>Judging is broken up into two parts: the expo, and the top 10. During the expo category prize winners will be selected, as well as the general top 10 hacks. Each of the top 10 will win a &quot;top 10&quot; prize. From there, they will pitch their hack to a panel of final judges during closing ceremony.</p>

	<p>For category prizes, please note that you must opt in to be judged for them on <a target = "_blank" href = "https://hackbca4.devpost.com"/>Devpost</a>. If you do not opt in, you will not be considered.</p>

	<div id = "prizes">
	<h2>Top 10</h2>
	<p>To place in the top 10, you'll need to consider the following four guiding principles when building your hack:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p class = "top10-title">Technical Difficulty</p>
			<p>Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick on an API, or were there real technical challenges to surmount? This is the most important criterion that your hack will be judged upon for the general prizes. Please keep in mind that your experience level will be taken into account!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class = "top10-title">Originality</p>
			<p>Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/local app? Does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class = "top10-title">Polish</p>
			<p>Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does everything appear to work? Is it well designed?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class = "top10-title">Usefulness</p>
			<p>Is the hack practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfill a real need people have?</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Best Pitch</h2>
	<p>Awarded to the team with the best pitch during the expos. To win the prize, you'll need to be an expert at selling what you've built.</p>

	<h2>Best App using Wolfram Tech</h2>
	<p>If you plan on building a hack using the technology Wolfram is providing us, this is for you. Whichever team comes up with the best project incorporating Wolfram, once again based on technical difficulty, originality, polish, and usefulness, will win.</p>

	<h2>Best Overall Beginner</h2>
	<p>This prize is awarded using the same criteria used to choose the top 10 teams, but with one caveat. The winning team must consist fully of beginners!</p>

	<h2>Most <i class="em em-fire"></i> Beginner Hack</h2>
	<p>This prize is exactly what it sounds like... Whichever beginner team builds the most fire project will get a spicy prize.</p>

	<h2>#HackHarassment</h2>
	<p>Use your tech skills for good and hack online harassment. Build a software solution that can help reduce the frequency and/or severity of online harassment. Any hack that tackles this issue and also adheres to the four guiding principles for judging can win!</p>

	<h2>Best Domain Name from domain.com</h2>
	<p>Come up with the most creative domain name for your website. Whichever team has their hack up on the best domain will win.</p>

	<h2>Best Education Hack</h2>
	<p>As high schoolers, we know that a lot of things could be improved when it comes to education. Build a hack that solves an issue in the field of education, whether it be for kindergarteners or college applications. Any hack that tackles this field and also adheres to the four guiding principles for judging can win!</p>

	<h2>Best Mobile App</h2>
	<p>If you've made an app for mobile, whether it be iOS, Android, FireOS, or more, this is for you. Once again, any mobile hack will be judged on the four guiding principles.</p>

	<h2>Best Web Hack</h2>
	<p>If you've built a hack on the web, whether it be a static website, a web app, an API, or more, this is for you. Like most other category hacks, this will be judged on the four guiding principles.</p>

	<h2>Best Use of Data</h2>
	<p>Data is everywhere these days - there's more of it than ever before. As more and more aspects of our lives go digital, there's more and more data available. Build a hack that harnesses the plethora of data available to win this prize. Again, the four guiding principles apply.</p>

	<h2>Most Polished</h2>
	<p>We all know how hackathon projects tend to go... they're sloppy, look bad, and only work for a few select hard-coded cases. If your hack goes against this trend, you can win this prize. As the name implies, the most polished project will win.</p>

	<h2>Best VR Hack</h2>
	<p>If you've built a hack for virtual reality, whether it be for the Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard (or others!), this is for you. Again, the four guiding principles are the main judging criteria.</p>

	<h2>Code for Good</h2>
	<p>This prize is for the best civic hack. If your project is for the general good, this is for you, whether it be related to government, social issues, etc. Again, the four guiding principles are the main judging criteria.</p>

	<h2>Best Use of 3D Printing</h2>
	<p>This year, we are providing more support for 3D Printing hacks than ever before. If you build something that incorporates 3D Printing, this is for you! Again, the four guiding principles apply.</p>

	<h2>Most Likely to Succeed as Startup</h2>
	<p>Sometimes, hackathon ideas would make great companies. Take Workflow, a company that started as a hack built by high schoolers that went on to be acquired by Apple, just a few days ago. If your hack has the potential to grow into a real company, you can win this prize.</p>

	<h2>Best Hardware Hack</h2>
	<p>We often forget that code isn't only something meant to be experienced on a phone or laptop. Code is everywhere, including in many of the physical things we use every day. This prize is for the hack that best combines the physical and programming worlds.</p>

	<h2>Best Use of AWS</h2>
	<p>Whichever hack uses Amazon Web Services the best can win this prize, whether that be using S3 as a database, Lambda to create an app for Amazon Echo, or more. Again, the four guiding principles are the main judging criteria.</p>
